add a cheat() function with inside the parenthesis adds whatever number you put in it, as long as it is a multiple of 2. (2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512,1024,2048,4096,8192,16384,32768) end it at 32768. make it so i can go into console and do cheat(32,x,y) where x is the lateral distance from the bottom left corner and y is the verical distance from the bottom left corner. so if I want the top left to be 32, i would type in the js console "cheat(32,0,3)". throw an error if either coordinates is less than 0 or greater than 3. throw an error if the first number is not a multiple of 2 or greater than 32768.
